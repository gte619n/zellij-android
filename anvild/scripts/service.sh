# web/dist (see src/server/http.ts WEB_DIR). The daemon itself runs from TS source, so a bare
# kickstart picks up daemon code changes — but it does NOT regenerate web/dist. For a long time
# `restart` only kickstarted, so a `git pull` + `restart` shipped new daemon code while silently
# serving the OLD web UI (the classic "my change merged but the dropdown/button isn't there"
# symptom). `restart` now runs `build:web` first so a pull+restart is a true full deploy. To
# verify the web change actually shipped, query the running daemon (not the browser, which the
# service worker may have cached):  curl -s http://127.0.0.1:7701/main.js | grep -c <your-string>

# Rebuild the web client into web/dist. Both `install` and `restart` call this so the bundle the
# daemon serves can never lag the source (see the DEPLOY NOTE at the top of this file). We run
# `bun install` first: a `git pull` can add a new dependency (e.g. sortablejs in #26), and
# `build:web` resolves imports straight out of node_modules — so without an install the build
# fails with "Could not resolve …" and the atomic dist swap silently keeps serving the old UI.
# An in-sync lockfile makes the install a fast no-op, so it's cheap to always run.
#
# CRITICAL: the rebuild is best-effort and must NEVER block the daemon from starting. The app ships a
# prebuilt web/dist (Provision copies it into the install root) and build.ts swaps atomically — a
# failed build leaves the existing dist untouched. So if install/build fails but a usable bundle is
# already present, warn and carry on with it; only hard-fail when there's no dist to serve at all.
# (Before this, `set -e` let a failed `build:web` abort `do_install` *before* the LaunchAgent was
# bootstrapped — a transient build error left the daemon dead and fleet clients stuck "connecting".)
