/**
 * Daemon self-update (arch §5). The daemon runs from TS source under a launchd service that
 * serves the *built* web bundle from web/dist. A deploy is therefore: pull the daemon's own
 * source repo, rebuild web/dist, then restart so the new source is re-read. This module does all
 * three so it can be triggered from any client instead of shelling into the host (see service.sh,
 * which does the same steps by hand).
 *
 * All steps shell out asynchronously (Bun.spawn) so a slow build never blocks the event loop /
 * other sessions. Restart is done with `launchctl kickstart -k` (the same path service.sh uses):
 * launchd's KeepAlive does NOT respawn after a clean SIGTERM exit (verified empirically), so a bare
 * self-SIGTERM would shut the daemon down for good — kickstart -k deterministically kills + respawns.
