## What is Anvil?

Anvil lets you **run Claude Code on your dev machine and drive it from anywhere** — your
phone on the couch, a tablet, or another laptop. A small daemon (`anvild`) supervises your
Claude Code sessions and streams them as **structured data** — markdown, tool calls, diffs,
git state — to thin native clients over [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com). Nothing is
public; your machine and your devices talk directly over your private tailnet.

It's the kind of thing you reach for when you want to kick off a task on your workstation,
put your phone in your pocket, and get pulled back by a push notification when Claude
finishes — or needs your permission for something risky.

> [!NOTE]
> **Anvil started life as a Zellij-in-a-WebView app and was rebuilt from the ground up.**
> The old approach scraped a terminal grid; the current one drives Claude Code through the
> [Agent SDK](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/sdk) and forwards typed events.
> See [Why a rebuild?](#why-a-rebuild) and [`docs/plans/anvil-native-architecture.md`](docs/plans/anvil-native-architecture.md).

### What you get

- 💬 **Conversation, not a terminal grid** — reflowable markdown, syntax-highlighted code,
  tables, math, and **mermaid diagrams**, rendered once on the daemon and shown identically
  on every device. Proportional fonts, real text inputs (Shift+Enter is a newline).
- 📱 **Multi-device, no shared viewport** — pick up your phone mid-conversation and it
  reconciles to exactly where your laptop left off. No "disconnect the other client" dance.
- 🌳 **Worktree-per-session** — each task can spin up its own git worktree off a base branch.
  Branch, diffstat, and git lifecycle (commit / push / PR / merge) are first-class.
- 🛡️ **Mostly-autonomous with a danger-list backstop** — auto-allows ordinary tool use,
  prompts only on genuinely risky ops (`rm -rf`, force-push, secret access). Permission
  prompts become native dialogs answerable from any device.
- 🔔 **Push when it matters** — a notification when a session needs a decision or a turn
  completes. Web Push today; FCM (Android) / APNs (Apple) for native shells.
- 🖥️ **A real terminal when you need one** — a persistent, server-side PTY per session,
  with durable scrollback across device switches.
- 📄 **Live markdown reader** — open a doc and chat about it side-by-side; it re-renders in
  place as Claude edits it, with select-to-cite back into the conversation.
- 🔗 **Fleet-ready** — one client can manage `anvild` across several Macs on one Max plan.

## Quick start

You need a machine with [Bun](https://bun.sh) ≥ 1.3.14, a Claude **Max** subscription, and
[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) on every device you want to drive from.

```sh
# 1. Install dependencies
cd anvild
bun install

# 2. Authenticate with your Claude subscription (one-time).
#    This uses the subscription pool — NOT a metered API key (see "Auth & billing" below).
export CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN="$(claude setup-token)"

# 3. Run the daemon — serves the web client + WebSocket API on :7701
bun run start
#    → open http://localhost:7701
```

Then expose it to your other devices over Tailscale:

```sh
tailscale serve --bg --https=443 http://localhost:7701
#    → open https://<your-magicdns-host>/  from your phone or tablet
```

For an always-on install (macOS LaunchAgent that restarts on crash and at login), and a
non-technical, terminal-free setup, see [Running it for real](#running-it-for-real).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Auth & billing is a hard constraint.** Anvil only ever drives Claude through the Agent
> SDK, authenticated by your subscription's OAuth token. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` /
> `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` **must be unset** — a stray API key silently switches every turn to
> metered pay-per-token billing, so the daemon **refuses to start** if one is present.
> Full rationale: [`anvil-native-architecture.md` §3](docs/plans/anvil-native-architecture.md).

## System overview

A single daemon on your dev box hosts Claude Code and forwards structured events; thin
native shells render them. Everything between them rides your private tailnet.

        direction TB

    class anvild daemon;
    class web,android,apple,cc,wt,push box;
```

`anvild` replaces **both** the old Python status server *and* Zellij — it owns the session
lifecycle end-to-end, so there are no sockets to negotiate or husk processes to reap.

---

## How it works

### A session is one conversation against one working tree

You create a session by pointing it at an **existing directory** (a quick poke) or asking
for a **fresh git worktree** off a base branch (an isolated task). The daemon spawns a
supervised Claude Code process in its own process group, records the session, and persists
an append-only event log that is the source of truth for replay.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> idle: session.create
    idle --> thinking: prompt.send
    thinking --> running_tool: tool_use
    running_tool --> thinking: tool_result
    thinking --> awaiting_permission: danger-list hit
    running_tool --> awaiting_permission: danger-list hit
    awaiting_permission --> running_tool: permission.respond (allow)
    awaiting_permission --> thinking: permission.respond (deny)
    thinking --> idle: result (turn complete)
    running_tool --> error: crash
    idle --> exited: session.kill
    error --> exited: reap
    exited --> [*]
```

### A turn, end to end

Every server→client event carries a per-session monotonic `seq`, which is the backbone of
resume: a client persists the highest `seq` it has rendered and, on reconnect, asks the
daemon to replay everything newer (or sends a full snapshot if the client is too far behind).

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as You (any device)
    participant D as anvild
    participant C as Claude Code (Agent SDK)

    U->>D: prompt.send { text }
    D->>C: drive turn
    C-->>D: assistant deltas (streaming)
    D-->>U: assistant.delta … (seq++)
    C->>D: tool_use (e.g. Edit)
    D->>D: autonomy policy + danger-list
    alt risky op
        D-->>U: permission.request  +  📲 push
        U->>D: permission.respond { allow }
    end
    D->>C: run tool
    C-->>D: tool_result
    D-->>U: tool.use / tool.result (seq++)
    C->>D: turn complete
    D-->>U: result + budget  +  📲 push
```

### Why markdown is rendered on the daemon

Markdown (chat bubbles **and** the reader pane) is rendered **once, in the daemon**, and
displayed in a scoped, read-only WebView in the native shells:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    md["Markdown"] --> mdit["markdown-it<br/>(+ data-line attrs)"]
    mdit --> shiki["Shiki<br/>syntax highlight"]
    shiki --> katex["KaTeX<br/>math → HTML"]
    katex --> purify["DOMPurify<br/>sanitize"]
    purify --> html["Safe HTML"]
    html --> wv["WebView"]
    mermaid["mermaid.js<br/>(strict CSP)"] --> wv
    classDef step fill:#635F6A,stroke:#2F2739,color:#F0F6FC;
    class mdit,shiki,katex,purify,mermaid step;
    classDef out fill:#D39450,stroke:#2F2739,color:#2F2739;
    class html,wv out;
```

This buys **one** rendering pipeline across web/Android/Apple (mermaid, math, and
select-to-cite all work) instead of maintaining divergent native renderers. The native
shells still own everything else: navigation, layout, lists, input, terminal, and file tree.
Full reasoning in [`anvil-native-architecture.md` §8.3](docs/plans/anvil-native-architecture.md).

## Components

| Component | Path | Stack | What it is |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Daemon** | [`anvild/`](anvild/) | TypeScript · Bun | Session supervisor, Agent SDK streaming, event log, git/worktree ops, permissions, budget, render pipeline, push. The keystone. |
| **Web client** | [`anvild/web/`](anvild/web/) | Vanilla TS | The daily-driver UI and the reusable render surface, served by the daemon at `/`. Also bundled into the native shells. |
| **Android app** | [`app/`](app/) | Kotlin | A WebView shell hosting the web client over Tailscale + native FCM push, ADB-over-Tailscale, offline app-shell. `com.gte619n.anvil`. |
| **Apple app** | [`apple/`](apple/) | SwiftUI · WKWebView | macOS-first hybrid shell (same model as Android); iOS + APNs gated on an Apple Developer account. |
| **Server control panel** | [`anvil-server/`](anvil-server/) | SwiftUI | A macOS menu-bar app that stands up and manages `anvild` and joins Macs into a fleet — terminal-free setup. |
| **Build & release scripts** | [`scripts/`](scripts/) | Bash · TS | CI release notes + Apple Developer ID signing. |

---

## Running it for real

The daemon is built to run unattended on a macOS LaunchAgent.

```sh
cd anvild
./scripts/service.sh install     # build web, install + load the LaunchAgent, wire tailscale serve
./scripts/service.sh status      # service state + /api/health
./scripts/service.sh restart     # kickstart past launchd backoff
./scripts/service.sh logs        # tail the daemon log
```

It installs a launcher that sources `~/.config/anvil/env`, strips any
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` from the environment, runs at login, and
restarts on crash. No secrets live in the plist. See [`anvild/README.md`](anvild/README.md).

For a **terminal-free** setup — install Bun, capture the OAuth token, wire Tailscale, and
join several Macs into a fleet from a menu-bar UI — use the **Anvil Server** app in
[`anvil-server/`](anvil-server/).

---

## Why a rebuild?

The original Anvil drove Claude Code inside a PTY, inside Zellij, surfaced through Zellij's
browser web client, wrapped in a WebView. Nearly every frustration traced to one root cause:
**using a terminal multiplexer for something that isn't fundamentally terminal work.**

| Pain point (Zellij era) | Root cause | Fixed by |
|---|---|---|
| Monospace prose hard to read | bytes-on-a-grid | structured markdown, proportional fonts |
| Shift+Enter ≠ newline | terminal key encoding | native text inputs |
| Viewport fights across devices / foldables | one shared character grid | reflowable structure, no shared viewport |
| Can't paste/drag images & files | a PTY only takes byte streams | first-class structured attachments |
| Sessions opaque, won't die | Zellij owned lifecycle via sockets/husks | daemon owns lifecycle + process-group kill |
| All tabs/titles look identical | no structured metadata | rich session list with previews + git state |

The reframe: **Anvil is a Claude client that occasionally needs a terminal**, not a
terminal that occasionally talks to Claude. The full design — including the load-bearing
auth/billing constraint and the protocol — lives in
[`docs/plans/anvil-native-architecture.md`](docs/plans/anvil-native-architecture.md).
